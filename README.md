### Rishika here! Your friendly nextdoor alien.ðŸ‘½

<p>
I am a CSE undergrad at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra (Jaipur Campus). My first programming language is `Python`. I need to code in `C` for the college coding labs and I recently picked up `C++`. I love exploring new tech and I tend to ask too many questions, let's just say my curiosity is difficult to quench.
