#### Rishika here! Your friendly nextdoor alien ðŸ‘½

I am a CSE undergrad at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra (Jaipur Campus). My first programming language is `Python`. I need to code in `C` for the college coding labs and I recently picked up `C++`. I love exploring new tech and I tend to ask too many questions, let's just say my curiosity is difficult to quench. 

### My Communities <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1093585928642162688/oVdX1KD-.jpg" alt="WTM" width="25" height="25"/> <img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_lpad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco/v1489131517/tbocpzcm3bnpjdscmlhc.png" alt="WTM" width="25" height="25"/> 

I am a **Women Techmakers Engineering Fellow** under *Google* and *TalentSprint*. This is an experiential program along with 125 other girls my age from all over India. I owe a lot to this supportive, encouraging and self-improving community (including my peers, mentors and instructors).

I am also a *Head Coordinator* and mentor at the **Computer Society of India, Student Chapter - Jaipur** in our college. We aim to build a community with a strong growth mindset at our college. Our motto is *Sabka saath, sabka vikas*
